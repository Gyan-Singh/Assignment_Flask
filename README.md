## Web Application Documentation

### Purpose and Functionality

The web application is a ChatGPT integration using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model. It allows users to enter queries or messages, which are then sent to the ChatGPT API for processing. The application receives a response from the API and displays it on the results page. The purpose of the application is to showcase how the ChatGPT model can be used to generate conversational responses based on user input.

### Setup and Installation

To set up and install the web application, please follow these instructions:

**1. Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
- An OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, sign up on the OpenAI website to obtain an API key.

**2. Clone the Repository:**

Clone the repository containing the web application code:

```
$ git clone <repository_url>
$ cd <repository_directory>
```

**3. Install Dependencies:**

Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the necessary Python packages, including Flask and the OpenAI Python library.

**4. Set the API Key:**

Open the `app.py` file in a text editor and locate the line that sets the OpenAI API key:

```python
openai.api_key = "sk-.."
```

Replace `"sk-.."` with your actual OpenAI API key.

**5. Run the Application:**

Execute the following command in your terminal to start the Flask development server:

```
$ python app.py
```

The application should now be running locally on `http://localhost:5000/`.

### Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can access it by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000/`. The following sections explain how to use the different features of the application:

**Homepage:**

The homepage displays a form where you can enter your query or message. Type your input in the provided text box and click the "Submit" button.

**Results Page:**

After submitting your query, you will be redirected to the results page. The page will display two sections:

- **Your Query:** This section shows the query you entered.
- **API Result:** This section displays the response generated by the ChatGPT API based on your query.

### Conclusion

This technical documentation provides an overview of the purpose and functionality of the web application, as well as instructions on how to set up, install, and run it. By following these steps, users will be able to use the application to interact with the ChatGPT API and generate conversational responses based on their queries.
